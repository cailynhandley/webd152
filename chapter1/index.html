    <p>My favorite drink is Dr. Pepper. When I was younger, I wasn't allowed to drink soda, so now its like a special occasion whenever I have it. For some reason Dr. Pepper tastes so good to me and is very refreshing on a hot day or with dinner. I also like that it contains a little bit of caffeine without providing too much. </p>
